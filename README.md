# Website Hosted In a QR code!
Ever wonder what a QR code is, where it's from, how it came to be? Or what those three squares in the corners mean? Find out on a offline website, built into a QR code!

### Stuff I learned While Building This
- QR Facts
- How to save space
  - I spent hours cutting down on my initial website to get it under the 3kb mark
  - Every Character counts!
  - Using # instead of â–ˆ saves roughly 4x space per character (MADE HUGE DIFFERENCE)
- Multiple buttons can map to one function in js (Don't know why I had multiple duplicates until the end lol)
- Perservance!
